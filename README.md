- Main view with a table that shows the vehicles and a paginator. In case that user's is an admin, Edit and Delete buttons must been show, but normal user only get vehicles data.
- Dashboard view. A view with a bar graph that count how many elements of every vehicle we can find on the database.

This app will be connected to a Node/Express API with GET/POST/PUT/DELETE methods that get the data from a MongoDB.
